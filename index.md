<h2>Dr Armelle Bauer</h2>

<h3>Who I am ?</h3>

Hello, my name is Armelle Bauer and I'm a doctor of computer science. Nice to meet you! <br/>
With a computer graphics background, my main interests relate to realâ€‘time, characters animation, interactions and crowds behaviors, mixed reality, AI algorithms.
Highly motivated I am looking to create and work on intuitive, innovative and disruptive tools.

I'm curious and like to experiment, look at different technologies and play with them.
Because I'm a kinesthetic; sports, music and arts (sculpting, drawing, ...) are what helps me maintain myself focused<!--up and running-->.
I've got a soft spot for all water-related activities: I'm a free and scuba diver (N3), and working on my instructor level on marine biology (FB1).

<h3>Why this website?</h3>

Have you ever felt that your CV doesn't really reflect who you are and what you're worth?
This website is all about this.<!--Who you are and what you like to do don't necessarily come out of our actions.-->
I'm a bit reserved, and I hope that with this website I will be able to communicate more about myself while doing things I like to do.

If you divide your day in three equal parts, one is reserved to sleep (because sleeping is mandatory), one to work, and the last one for yourself.
But that last part also contains all inherent things of life: eat, clean, clean yourself, do some sports, go to work, etc.
So in the end, to have a fulfilling life, you need to do a job that you like, that matters to you. And that's what I intend to do.

This website is a way to present myself outside the CV framework.
I hope you will enjoy going through the different parts of it as much as I enjoyed myself experimenting on it.
You will learn more about me, my work and what matters to me.
